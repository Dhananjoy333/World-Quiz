My first full stack working website with frontend, backend and database. Deployed with Neondb as database, render.com for backend and netlify for frontend. 
A simple website to test your country capital name knowledge and your flag recognisation skills.
Although the website doesnot have database to store individual user scores as no login section is present (p.s. working on adding the login feature.)
